a. Types of memory-
1. Statistically Allocated Memory-
STACK
2. Dynamically Allocated Memory-
HEAP
Intro to Pointers

b. Arrays and Vectors- 1D data structures containing the elements. list of data values, inside them we can store multipke values.
The memory section in which they are stored as arrays are statically allocated(STACK) and vectors are dynamically allocated(HEAP- intro to pointers in c and cpp programming simultaneously) 

c. Memory managment of arrays and vectors (pointers)-
In arrays- memory allocation is done by malloc function and deletion of that memory is done by free function
whereas
In vectors- by new int and by delete[] function respectively.
